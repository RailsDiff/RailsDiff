<h2>Why RailsDiff was built:</h2>

<p>When upgrading the version of Rails used in an application, it can be
difficult to know precisely every detail that should be changed.</p>

<p>Often, just modifying the Rails gem version in your Gemfile and then
running bundle update rails seems to work: your tests still pass, application
runs like normal, etc. So, you never think twice and go about continuing to
develop your application. But, were there other changes that could/should have
been made as well? Perhaps, Rails has changed the default value for some
configuration settings, or perhaps new configuration settings have been added
since your application was generated.</p>

<p>What the Rails application generator creates is specific to the version of
Rails it was generated for. So, as new versions of Rails are released, what the
application generator creates can change; and, comparing the output of
different versions of the generator can give you some understanding of the
changes going on in Rails.</p>

<p>So, to that end, I've generated applications for each version of Rails;
and, for each version, I've generated a diff between it and all versions before
it. You can use these diffs to know precisely every change needed to upgrade to
any version of Rails.</p>
